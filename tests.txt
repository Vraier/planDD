[x] test all variable and clause orderings (naive encoding)
    [X] clause orders (T1)
    [x] var orders (T2)
    [ ] do the same for reverse orderings (sure?)

[x] test different building strategies (T3)
    [x] build linear
    [x] build layer by layer
    [x] exponential
    [x] bidirectional
    [x] with variable permutation
    [ ] without dynamic reordering
    [ ] tree?

[ ] test different encodings (T6)
    [ ] naive
    [ ] ladder encoding
    [ ] direct encoding
    [ ] binary (operators, variables, both, excluding) 
    [ ] parallel (how?)
    [ ] binary parallel

[ ] test force ordering vor variables and clauses
    [ ] with random seed and without
[ ] test the influence of dynamic reordering

[ ] test the grouping of variables in the order

[ ] test naive bdd (T4)
    - force var order
    - bottom up clause order
    - dynamic shifting
[ ] test naive sdd
    - compiler (dynamic, v-tree search, bottom up clause order)

[ ] test incremental approaches
[ ] compare with competitors
    [ ] topk track (incremental)
    [ ] topq track

[ ] implement proof of concept (T5)
    [ ] uniform random plan
    [ ] what is the most likely action to end
